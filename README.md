# Stereo Vision Disparity Map Calculation Using Normalized Cross-Correlation 

## Description  
This project calculates the disparity map between two stereo images (left and right) using the method of Normalized Cross-Correlation (NCC). The disparity map is essential for depth estimation and 3D reconstruction tasks. The algorithm compares small windows in the left and right images to find corresponding pixels based on their correlation, yielding a disparity map representing the depth information.
